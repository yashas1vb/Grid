Grid

Assignment

1. What is a Grid?

An intersection of vertical and horizontal lines is known as a grid.
Major sections of a page are separated using CSS Grid layout.
The grid layout enables us to construct grid structures represented in CSS rather
than HTML.

2. What is the difference between flex and grid?

Flexbox:

Primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.
Useful for laying out items in a single direction, either horizontally or vertically.
Well-suited for creating flexible and dynamic layouts when the size of the items is unknown or varies.

Grid:

Designed for two-dimensional layouts, involving both rows and columns.
Allows you to create complex grid-based layouts where items can be placed both horizontally and vertically.
Suitable for creating more structured and grid-like designs, such as a traditional webpage layout.

3. How can you define rows and cloumns for your grid?

Using properties grid-row and grid-cloumn we can define the rows and columns for our grid.

Grid-row: defines on which row to place an item. You can also state here,
where the item will start, and where the item will end. To place an item, you
can either use line numbers, or use span to define how many columns the
item will span.

Grid-column: defines on which column the item is to be placed. Like a row,
here too, it can be stated where the item will start and end. Here again, you
can either use line numbers, or use span to define how many columns the
item will span.



4. List any 2 properties of the grid item and grid container.

Grid Container Properties:
 1. The display property with a value of grid is used to define a grid container.
 2. The 'grid-template-rows' and 'grid-template-columns'

Grid item properties:
 1. The 'grid-row' and 'grid-column'
 2. And the 'grid-area'
